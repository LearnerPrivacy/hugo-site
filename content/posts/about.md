I am launching a Learning Privacy podcast to address privacy issues for our learners.    While we have made great progress in educational technology interoperability, we have done so with wanton disregard for the protection of learners' privacy.  In 2002, there were no useful standards for moving software or content among commercial learning management systems.  Each system had its own "plugin" and "backup/restore" format.

If we go back to 2002, there were no useful standards around
moving software or content between commercial learning management systems.
Every system had their own "plugin" and "backup/restore" format.

With the rise of open source LMS alternatives in the early 2000's like
Sakai and Moodle, commercial LMS vendors were forced to come
to the standards table.  After over 
a decade of effort, standards like IMS Learning Tools Interoperability
and IMS Common Cartridge addressed the important need for data portability and
software interoperability.

Almost two decades later with the release of the IMS LTI Advantage suite
of specifications, learning software interopability is in very good shape
but learner privacy is a disaster.

To address this significant problem we have to look at the
past (when and how we made privacy mistakes in the rush to interoperability),
present (how the headlong rush to the 'cloud' led us to ignore privacy issues),
and future (how we can unwind these mistakes when so many of our cloud
vendors see our private data as their asset).

It is a long and interesting story and will take a while to tell.
I look forward to hearring from all of you along the way to a future
where learner privacy matters.
